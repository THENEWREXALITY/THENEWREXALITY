My name is Samuel Chizalema and this is my portfolio

I'm a student learning web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript & php), Database Creation, application Development (Visual Basic & C#) and aspiring in animation and Graphic design.

I will post projects here to build up my portfolio and learn from my archives (I hope it will live up to my expectations).

Feel free to look around and see what you like.
